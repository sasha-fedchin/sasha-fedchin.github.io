I think Boston is a great place to shoot dystopian movies. There is this massive concrete city hall (center), there is a tower that has no windows on one side like the Ministry of Love in “1984” (part of the Christian Science Center, left), there is a giant mental health center (right) and many more interesting examples of brutalist architecture. Not all in one place, of course, as on this picture, but not too far apart either.
