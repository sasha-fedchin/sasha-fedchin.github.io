An illustration for the sixteenth chapter of "La Belle Sauvage", which is a prequel to "His Dark Materials" trilogy. It would be fun if BBC adapted this after they are done with the "Amber Spyglass". The gist is that two teenagers have to carry baby Lyra from Oxford to London on a canoe during a devastating flood. And at some point they have to break into a pharmacy.
