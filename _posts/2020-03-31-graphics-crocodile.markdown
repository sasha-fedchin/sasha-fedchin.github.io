The statue of a crocodile at Hadrian's villa in Tivoli (resort near Rome). When I was here in 2009, I thought that the crocodile is a modern addition, with what looks like reinforcing bars and everything, but, apparently, it is almost two thousand years old. The reflecting pond by which the crocodile stands represents the Nile.
