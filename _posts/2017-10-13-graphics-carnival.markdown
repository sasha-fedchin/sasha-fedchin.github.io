A carvinal in an imaginary land where there is no pandemic and you don’t have to think about social distancing. I used photos from the Met website for reference. They have an amazing online collection and, what’s more, many images are in the public domain or licensed under CC, which is really one of the best things about museums like the Met and the British Museum. I wish I could say the same about Hermitage, but their online collection is small, the interface is inconvenient, and the copyright rules are not made clear (updated from 2022: they also support the war...). Maybe this will change one day!
