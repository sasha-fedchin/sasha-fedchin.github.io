**Metamorph** is a program synthesis tool for the Dafny programming language that targets the problem of generating large heap-based objects from user-provided specifications. Metamorph can synthesize programs that include up to 57 method calls. Metamorph can also be integrated with <a href="{{site.url}}/2024/12/06/dtest.html">DTest</a> to generate more complex heap-based test inputs.
