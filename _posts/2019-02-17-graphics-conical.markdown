A sculptural (or architectural?) collage. Featured are Gordon Matta-Clark’s “Conical Intersect” and Richard Serra’s “Tilted Arc.”

I wanted to post a photo of Matta-Clarks’s work along with my picture, but couldn’t find any publicly licensed images to use. Matta-Clark has been dead for almost half a century; “Conical Intersect” was demolished three years before he died. Is it really fair that someone still holds copyright for any of these photos? They are all over the internet though, so you can easily google them.
