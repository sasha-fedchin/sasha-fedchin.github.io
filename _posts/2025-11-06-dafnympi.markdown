**DafnyMPI** is a library for writing provably correct **message-passing concurrent programs** in the Dafny programming language. 
DafnyMPI **rules out deadlocks** by enforcing an ordering property on message tags and allows reasoning about a program's output, including
proving functional equivalence between a reference sequential program and an optimized MPI implementation. 
Because DafnyMPI is a library (rather than a DSL or a language extension), it both inherits all the functionality available to Dafny developers and 
does not introduce any special-purpose language constructs. Instead, DafnyMPI relies on method preconditions to enforce all the necessary correctness properties.

<p>DafnyMPI is
also <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17102521">available as an artifact</a> for an upcoming POPL 2026 paper (co-authored with Antero Mejr, Jeffrey Foster, and Hari Sundar). We have
used DafnyMPI to verify correctness or three canonical PDE solvers: Linear Convection, Poisson, and Heat Diffusion.</p>
