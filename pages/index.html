<p>I am a CS PhD student at Tufts university working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff Foster</a> on automated testing for verification-aware languages, such as <a href="https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/">Dafny</a>. During summers, I intern at Amazon and work on various Dafny-related projects. I am also a member of the <a href="http://qcrit.com/">Quantitative Criticism Lab</a> at UT Austin, where I study Latin and Neo-Latin poetry. Occasionally, I <a href="/graphics/">draw things</a> in Photoshop.</p>
