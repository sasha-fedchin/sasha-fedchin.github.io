<p>I am a Berlin-based computer scientist with a PhD in CS from Tufts University (defended in October 2025) and four internships as an Applied Scientist at AWS. My research focuses on program verification, most recently of concurrent MPI software, with publications at TACAS, NFM, OOPSLA, and POPL.</p>

<p>I also have a strong interest in NLP and ML, with an ML internship at JetBrains and publications at NAACL and AJP. Occasionally, I create digital artwork in Photoshop.</p>
